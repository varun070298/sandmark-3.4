/section{Introduction}
The NodeSplitting obfuscation algorithm obfuscates a class file 
by splitting a node into two, i.e. some of the fields from the class are moved
into a newly created class and all references to those fields in the given class are modified to reflect the changes.
/section{Code Sample}

Consider the following code:
/begin{verbatim}
class A {
	int i;
	private float f;
	public A(){ }
	public void dummy() {
		i=10;
		f=12.2;
	}
}

After Obfuscation :
class A {
	int i;
	A1 next;
	public A() {
		next = new A1();
	}
	public void dummy() {
		i=10;
		next.f = 12.2;
	}
}
class A1 {
	public float f;
	public A1() { }
}
