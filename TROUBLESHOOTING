Q: Why do my mark()-calls get mysteriously purged from the call-graph?
A: You didn't compile sandmark (or, more precisely, sandmark.trace.Annotator)
   with '-g'.

Q: Why do I get lots of compilation errors involving
   sun.com.jdi*?
A: The JDK variable in the Makedefs file has not been
   set correctly. It must point to the directory where
   the jdk lives, so we can pick up the path to the
   rt.jar library.

Q: Why do I get a compilation error involving
   sun.com.jdi.request.VMDeathRequest?
A: You are not running jdk1.4.

Q: I get lots of errors when I run 'make test'. What
   should I do?
A: Don't run 'make test'.

Q: I get a com/sun/jdi/connect/IllegalConnectorArgumentsException when
   tracing using the CT algorithm.  What's going wrong?  
A: You don't have tools.jar set correctly in your path.  Verify that
   tools.jar exists in a subdirectory of jdk1.4 home and that the
   classpath is correctly set to point to it.

Q: I'm adding a new obfuscation/watermarking algorithm, type "make",
   type "make run", everything works except my algorithm doesn't
   show up in the gui? What's going on here?
A: You must add the directory name to sandmark/obfuscate/Makefile or
   sandmark/watermark/Makefile.
Q: OK, it still doesn't work.
A: Did you remember to set the "package sandmark...." right?
Q: OK, it still doesn't work.
A: Do you have a constructor? There must be a default public 
   constructor.
Q: It works!
A: I know.
