	 This directory contains a simple obfuscator that inserts a buggy code into the CFG
of a random methods taken from a classfile. The obfuscator takes a random basic block and 
makes a copy of the basic block and introduces a bogus jump to it through an opaque predicate.
The bug codes are introduced in the new basic block by tampering with the local variables in
the method.  

The directory contains the following files:

   README
   Makefile
   package.html

   BugCode.java
   doc (directory) - help.html
