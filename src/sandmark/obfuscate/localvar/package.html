Contains an obfuscator that scrambles the local variables used in 
a method.  This obfuscator performs live range analysis for each
of the local variables in a method, and then performs a register
allocation based on those live ranges.  As a result, variables
that were not the same variable will merge, and previously merged
variables will be split apart.
