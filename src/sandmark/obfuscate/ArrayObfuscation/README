Algorithm Design & Implementation : {Ashok Purushotham Ramasamy Venkatraj} ashok@cs.arizona.edu

The Array Splitting algorithm splits a single array ,which is a local variable in a method ,into two arrays and modifies all the array
initialization ,read,write,and arraylength references consistently and correctly .

Files :
IntArraySplitter.java : The class file which does the actual implementation of the Integer Array Splitting .

Future Work :
1) Extending Array Splitting for other basic types
2) Implementing Array Merging Obfuscation . I believe that ,the integration of Array Spltting and Array Merging into one
obfuscation will provide better results .
