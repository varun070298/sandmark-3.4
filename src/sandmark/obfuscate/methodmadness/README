Algorithms in sandmark/obfuscate/methodmaddness
    - Method2RMaddness by: Kelly Heffner and Martin Stepp
      Method2RMaddness runs each of the smaller method signature 
      scrambling algorithms in sequence for the optimal scrambling.
    - Method Merger by: Kelly Heffner
      Method Merger combines static methods with the same signature 
      into one large method.
    - Parameter Reorderer by: Martin Stepp
      Parameter Reorderer permutes the signatures of static methods.
    - Primitive Promoter by: Martin Stepp and Kelly Heffner
      Primitive Promoter changes the signatures of each method so that
      all parameters are reference types descending from java.lang.Object.
    - Publicizer by: Martin Stepp
      Publicizer makes all methods in a class public.
    - Signature Bludgeoner by: Martin Stepp
      Signature Bludgeoner changes any static method with all
      reference type parameters and changes the parameter list to 
      a single array of Objects.
    - Static Method Bodies by: Kelly Heffner
      Static Method Bodies creates a new static method for every
      dynamic method, containing the same method body.  Each dynamic
      method body is replaced by a call to the static method.
