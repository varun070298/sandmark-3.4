Contains a collection of signature scrambling obfuscations.  This
collection of obfuscations when run together (using Method2RMaddness),
produces an application where all of the dynamic methods make calls
into one large static method (per class), that has the signature
([Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;.
