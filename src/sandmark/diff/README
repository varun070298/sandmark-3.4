 This directory contains modules that have been designed to diff two
 (and only two) jar files. The diff criteria is determined by the diff
 algorithm. These algorithms are split into method diff algorithms and 
 class diff algorithms which are located in subdirectories methoddiff and
 classdiff respectively. The GUI for the diff tool is located in 
 sandmark.gui.diff and can be run by creating a DiffFrame.

 To implement your own diff algorithm, extend classdiff.ClassDiffAlgorithm
 or methoddiff.MethodDiffAlgorithm depending on which your algorithm compares.
 This requires you to implement 4 methods:
	-getName()
	-getDescription()
	-diff{Methods,Classes}()
	-color()

 Currently, the GUI code does not dynamically load algorithms, so you will 
 have to update sandmark.gui.diff.DiffFrame by inserting an instance of your
 algorithm into the algorithms vector.

 If your algorithm compares something else (e.g. Application), create your own 
 subpackage, e.g. appdiff. Then subclass DiffAlgorithm, implementing run(),
 getTaskLength(), getCurrent(), and diff(). You may want to add an abstract
 method diffApp() for typechecking. See methoddiff.MethodDiffAlgorithm and
 classdiff.ClassDiffAlgorithm for examples. Then extend that class to implement
 your algorithm.
