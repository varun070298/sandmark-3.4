This package takes a list <code>TracePoint.java</code>-objects
and turns it into a forest of call-graphs. This
graph is used to locate suitable <code>mark()</code>-locations.

<UL>
   <LI> <code>Forest.java</code> is the main class that constructs
        the call forest.
   <LI> <code>Build.java</code> builds the structure of the call
        graphs.
   <LI> <code>Decorate.java</code> adds weights to the call graph
        nodes and edges.
   <LI> <code>Edge.java</code> represents a call-graph edge.
   <LI> <code>Node.java</code> represents a call-graph node.
   <LI> <code>CallFrame.java</code> is just used internally.
   <LI> <code>Test.java</code> does some rudimentary testing
        of the package.
