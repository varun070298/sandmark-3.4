This directory contains a very simple static watermarker
that adds a bogus expression to the constant pool and 
recovers the watermark value. 

The watermark given in randomly split into 2 values and 
then the expression is formed using this the values which
is embedded in a random instruction list index of a 
random method.  The recognizer searches for the local variable
and takes action to recover the corresponding instructions
from the list and retrieve the watermark.

The directory contains the following files:

   Makefile
   README
   package.html

   BogusExpression.java     -- The watermark embedding and retrieving code.
   Test.java                -- A main wrapper to test the watermarker.
