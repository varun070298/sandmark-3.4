This package implements the tracing part of
the Collberg-Thomborson software watermarking algorithm. 

<UL>
   <LI> <code>Tracer.java</code> is the main class that
        gets called by the GUI when the user invokes tracing.
   <LI> The result of the trace is a list <code>TracePoint.java</code>-objects.
   <LI> The class <code>Preprocessor.java</code> adds extra code
        to the users application to prepare for a tracing run.
   <LI> <code>Mark()</code>-methods in <code>Annotator.java</code>
        are called by the user's application during tracing.
        They indicate places in the user's code where watermarks
        may be inserted.
   <LI> The package <code>callforest</code> takes a list
        <code>TracePoint.java</code>-objects
        and turns it into a forest of call-graphs. This
        graph is used to locate suitable <code>mark()</code>-locations.
