This package implements the Collberg-Thomborson software
watermarking algorithm. 
<UL>
   <LI> <code>CT.java</code> is the main class that invokes the
        <code>trace</code>, <code>encode</code>, <code>embed</code>, 
        and <code>recognize</code> functions.
   <LI> The <code>trace</code> package starts to run the application under
        debugging and records the execution locations where the 
        watermark could be inserted.
   <LI> The <code>encode</code> package converts a watermark (a string or a
        number) into a graph, and that graph into Java code
        that builds the graph.
   <LI> The <code>embed</code> package adds the graph-building code to
        application.
   <LI> <code>recognize</code> package again runs the application
        under debugging and prints out any watermarks it
        finds.
   <LI> The <code>doc</code> directory contains documentation.
</UL>
