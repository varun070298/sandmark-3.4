This directory contains a static watermarking algorithm. AssignLV is a watermarking algorithm that embeds the watermark in the local variable assignment by adding constraints to the interference graphs.

This watermarking algorithm relies heavily upon some utility classes 
found in sandmark.util.controlflowgraph.
 
The directory contains the following files:
   AssignLV.java        -- The watermarking code.
   FromBinary.java      -- Converts a binary string to its ASCII 
                           equivalent
   ToBinary.java        -- Converts an ASCII string to its binary 
                           equivalent
   MethodCompare.java   -- A technique for comparing methods so that 
                           they can be sorted
   Makefile             -- Commands to run the test code.
