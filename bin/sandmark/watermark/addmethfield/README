This directory contains a very simple static watermarker
that embeds the watermark by splitting it in half the first part becomes the name of a new field and the second becomes part of the name of a new method.

The directory contains the following files:
   AddMethField.java     -- The watermarking code.
   Makefile              -- Commands to run the test code.
