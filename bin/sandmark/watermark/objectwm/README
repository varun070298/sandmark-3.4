This directory contains a static watermarker that embeds the watermark in the
code as an instruction group frequency vector. The overall scheme is based on the Stern's
robust object watermark algorithm. The watermark instruction vector is formed out of
some code profiling information. Various embedding techinques such as code substitution, 
instruction group insertion, etc are used to build the watermark in the code.

The recognition procedure follows a different approach. Instead of retrieving the 
watermark directly from the target code, the recognizer is provided with both the 
original code and the new code along with the watermark. The recognizer then answers
with a 'yes/no' whether the particular watermark exists in the code.

The directory contains the following files:

   package.html
   Makefile
