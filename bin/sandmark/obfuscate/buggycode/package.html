This directory contains a simple obfuscator that inserts a buggy code into the control flow
graph of a random methods taken from a classfile. The obfuscator takes a random basic block and
makes a copy of the basic block and introduces a bogus jump to it through an opaque predicate.
The bug codes are introduced in the new basic block by tampering with the local variables in
the method.
