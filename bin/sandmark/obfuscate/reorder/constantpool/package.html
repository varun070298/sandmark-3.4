The constants in the constantpool are randomly assigned some
unique index within the length of the constantpool, and changes
should also be made to reflect the recursive indices within a
particular constantpool index.
There is no change in code as a result of this obfuscation.
Only those bytecode statements which use constantpool references,
those references should be modified according to the new random assignment.
