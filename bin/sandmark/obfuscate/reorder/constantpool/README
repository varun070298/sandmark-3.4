The  constants in the constantpool are randomly assigned some
unique index within the length of the constantpool  ,and changes
should also be made to reflect the recursive indices within a
particular constantpool index.

There is no change in code as a result of this obfuscation. Only
those bytecode statements which use constantpool references, those
references should be modified according to the new random assignment.

CPReorderer.java : The class file which does the actual implementation of the randomized
ConstantPool Reordering.
