This directory contains a very simple obfuscator that inserts a bogus field into a class. The obfuscation is done by inserting a bogus field into the class and then making assignments to that field in specific locations throughout the code. The specific locations are determined by the random selection of a ``sister'' field. Where ever assignments are made to the sister field an assignment to the bogus field also occurs.

The directory contains the following files:
   AddBogusFields.java  -- The obfuscator
   doc directory: help.HTML file
