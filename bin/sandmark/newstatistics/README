 This directory contains modules that have been designed to obtain various 
 complexity measures of the target code. In addition to all these complexity 
 measures, several other modules have been implemented. This analyzer module 
 performs various sorting operations in application, package, class or method 
 levels based on the complexity measure data obtained from the earlier
 statistic modules.


The directory contains the following files:

   package.html
   Makefile
