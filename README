SandMark is a tool developed at the University of Arizona for software
watermarking, tamper-proofing, and code obfuscation of Java
bytecode. The ultimate goal of the project is to implement and study
the effectiveness of all known software protection algorithms.

Running Sandmark
----------------

Note that you will need Java 1.4 to run SandMark properly.
Get it from:
   http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/

To run Sandmark under Windows, copy smarkstd.bat to smark.bat and edit
it to include the correct path to JDK1.4.  Double click this batch
file or type smark on the command line to run sandmark.

To run Sandmark under Unix, copy smark.std to smark and edit it to
include the correct path to JDK1.4.  Run this script to run sandmark.

Trying it out
-------------

To get started try watermarking the TTT (tic-tac-toe)
application:
   1) In the 'trace' pane enter
         "Jar-file to waternmark:" TTT.jar
         "Main class name:"        TTTApplication
   2) Hit <START>
   3) Click on a few X's and O's.
   4) Hit <DONE>
   5) In the 'embed' pane enter:
         "Watermark value:" 123456
   6) Hit <EMBED>
   7) Go to the 'recognize' pane and hit the <START> button.
   8) Click on the same X's and O's as you did in step 3),
      in the same order.
   9) Hit <DONE>.

You should see the watermark '123456' extracted from the 
watermarked TTT application.

Building Sandmark from source
-----------------------------

Do the following to build sandmark:
> cd smark
> cp Makedefs.std Makedefs
# Make the 'obvious' changes to Makedefs.
# In particular, you should set these variables:
#   JDK =
#   HOME = 

make superjar
java -jar sandmark.jar
